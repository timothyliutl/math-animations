# Manim Animations

## Introduction
This is the code I used to produce my manim animations. The goal of this project is for me to practice using Manim as well as producing visuals that may be helpful when learning calculus.

## How to Run
The codebase uses Manim Community Edition 0.16.0. An installation guide can be found in the following link: https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation.html

Once Manim Community Edition has been installed on the users computer, the animations can be created by entering the repository directory in the terminal and entering the following command:

```manim manim-projects.py {ClassName} -pqm```

Where {ClassName} refers to the names of the classes in the python file. The animations will be saved locally in a folder called ```media``` and a video file of the animation will be opened.

## Animations used in APSC 171 Tutorials
